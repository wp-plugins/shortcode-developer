Quickly create and edit shortcodes to use within your website.
This plugin gives you full PHP control whilst taking care of the hard work in the background.
Creating shortcodes has never been this easy!

== Description ==

The Shortcode Developer plugin provides a user firendly interface for creating custom shortcodes. Each shortcode consits of a name, a list of attibutes (with names and default values) and the PHP code executed to return the html back to the shortcode placeholder. 

Editing the PHP code is powered by the great browser editor "CodeMirror"!

A nice advantage of using this plugin over writing the shortcodes into the functions.php is that the shortcodes are not dependant on the theme. Also, this makes for a faster turn around for quick updates on live websites!
